## Descriptions
The prototype of the mobile healthy eating app was designed by Figma whose target users are university-level students. This app will:
- Allow users to subscribe by providing their personal data and eating habits preferences (such as whether the user is vegetarian or vegan, type of favorite foods, etc.).
- Enable users to search for recipes based on matching preferences (as entered in their profile), rating score range, specific ingredients input by the user, number of calories and/or preparation time. The user will also have the opportunity to mark (as used) selected recipes and rate them for quick access and for personal reports.
- Allow users to compare different recipes (e.g. ingredients, calories, nutritional values, etc.).
- Allow users to see periodic reports (e.g. daily, weekly, montly) of their eating habits based on the recipes they have used.

## Functionalities
The main functionalities of the app include:
### 1. Sign-up/Sign-in
The first screen that a user will see is the sign-up/sign-in option. A new user will select the sign-up option that will lead them to a user profile screen for data entry.

The profile data entry will require the new user to enter their details including first name, surname, date of birth, gender, nationality, current job, address, email, mobile phone, dietary requirements (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, allergies, etc.), food preferences, and a password. After the user completes the profile data
entry, they will be able to sign into the system.

Sign-in will involve entering an email and a password. After signing-in the user will be taken to the home screen, which will allow primary navigation to other functionalities: search for recipes, reports and comparison. This screen will welcome the user by their first name, and display a title (app name), a relevant
image, date, and a daily tip for healthy eating.

### 2. Multi-Criteria Search for recipes
The search should allow the user to select multiple matching attributes to find a recipes. These attributes involve the user profile data, specific ingredients input by the user, a rating range, number of calories and preparation time.

After selection, the app will display a list of recipes that meet these criteria. The list should be displayed with a title for each recipe and a thumbnail showing a picture of the final dish. You need to design this screen such that the details of matching recipes will not clutter the screen.

The user should then be able to choose any matching recipe. After selecting the desired recipe, the app should display the preparation instructions. Here the user should also be able to mark the recipe (which will indicate that the user has prepared the recipe) and rate it.

### 3. Comparison
This functionality will allow the user to select and compare two recipes at any given time. Here the user should be able to compare the recipes ingredients, calories, nutritional values, etc. The comparison should also display information such as the degree of similarity of the two recipes, preparation time, number of
servings, etc.

### 4. Reports
The reports will allow the user to view the list of recipes that have previously used, using the provided ratings to show them in order of preference.

The functionality will also enable the user to view periodic (daily, weekly and monthly) reports of their eating habits as graphs (static images). Specifically, it will allow the users to view three types of reports: calories intake, level of hydration (i.e. amount of water consumed), and types of food (junk food, fruits
and vegetables, grains and beans, meat and poultry, fish and seafood, and dairy).
